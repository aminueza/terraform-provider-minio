# This GitHub action publishes assets for release when a tag is created.
# Currently its setup to run on any tag that matches the pattern "v*" (ie. v0.1.0).
#
# Terraform Registry downloads providers from GitHub releases and verifies
# using GPG signatures (SHA256SUMS.sig). This workflow:
# 1. Builds binaries with GoReleaser
# 2. Signs with GPG (required for Terraform Registry)
# 3. Generates SBOM for dependency transparency
