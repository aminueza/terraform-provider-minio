# minio_ilm_policy (Resource)

`minio_ilm_policy` handles lifecycle settings for a given `minio_s3_bucket`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "minio_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket"
}

# Simple expiration rule
resource "minio_ilm_policy" "bucket-lifecycle-rules" {
  bucket = minio_s3_bucket.bucket.bucket

  rule {
    id         = "expire-7d"
    expiration = "7d"
  }
}

# Complex lifecycle policy with multiple rules
resource "minio_ilm_policy" "comprehensive-rules" {
  bucket = minio_s3_bucket.bucket.bucket

  # Rule with transition and expiration
  rule {
    id = "documents"
    transition {
      days          = "30d"
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }
    expiration = "90d"
    filter     = "documents/"
    tags = {
      "department" = "finance"
    }
  }

  # Rule with noncurrent version management
  rule {
    id = "versioning"
    noncurrent_expiration {
      days           = "60d"
      newer_versions = 5
    }
    noncurrent_transition {
      days           = "30d"
      storage_class  = "GLACIER"
      newer_versions = 3
    }
  }
}
```
