# minio_s3_bucket_tags (Resource)

Manages tags for S3 buckets in MinIO.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "minio_s3_bucket_tags" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "team-a"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `bucket` (String) Name of the bucket

### Optional

- `tags` (Map of String) Map of tags to assign to the bucket

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Notes

- This resource requires support for bucket tagging from the underlying S3-compatible endpoint. If your endpoint does not support tagging, you can set `skip_bucket_tagging = true` in the provider configuration to disable tagging operations and prevent errors.
- When `skip_bucket_tagging = true`, this resource will preserve the last known tag state in Terraform state without making API calls to the remote endpoint.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import minio_s3_bucket_tags.example example-bucket
```
