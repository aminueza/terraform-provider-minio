{{ .Description | trimspace }}

This data source queries MinIO's unauthenticated health check endpoints to monitor cluster health, liveness, readiness, quorum status, and whether it's safe to perform maintenance operations.

## Health Check Endpoints

The data source checks the following MinIO health endpoints:

- `/minio/health/live` - Server liveness (process running)
- `/minio/health/ready` - Server readiness (accepting requests)
- `/minio/health/cluster` - Write quorum status
- `/minio/health/cluster/read` - Read quorum status
- `/minio/health/cluster?maintenance=true` - Safe for maintenance check

All endpoints return HTTP 200 (healthy) or 503/412 (unhealthy/unsafe).

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/minio_health_status/data-source.tf" }}

## Use Cases

- **Conditional Resource Creation**: Create resources only when the cluster is healthy
- **Monitoring Integration**: Export health status to monitoring systems (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)
- **Deployment Validation**: Verify cluster health before/after deployments
- **Health Checks in CI/CD**: Automated health verification in pipelines
- **Maintenance Planning**: Check if it's safe to perform maintenance without losing quorum

## Understanding `safe_for_maintenance`

The `safe_for_maintenance` attribute indicates whether the cluster can tolerate taking a node offline for maintenance without losing read/write quorum. This is useful when:

- Planning rolling updates or upgrades
- Taking nodes offline for hardware maintenance
- Decommissioning nodes from the cluster

A value of `true` (HTTP 200) means the cluster has sufficient nodes online to maintain quorum if one node goes down. A value of `false` (HTTP 412) means taking a node offline would break quorum and potentially cause data unavailability.
