## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/minio_s3_bucket/resource.tf" }}

```terraform
resource "minio_s3_bucket" "data_lake" {
  bucket = "my-data-lake"

  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Team        = "data-engineering"
    CostCenter  = "12345"
  }
}
```

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Notes

- `bucket_prefix` is **create-only**. After a bucket exists in state, changes to `bucket_prefix` are ignored to avoid bucket replacement.
- During a `bucket` -> `bucket_prefix` migration, `bucket_prefix` may not be persisted in state (it can show up as empty in `terraform state show`) because diffs are suppressed to preserve the existing bucket.
- A migration from `bucket` to `bucket_prefix` can be done without replacement for an existing bucket when the current bucket name is compatible with the new prefix. For example:

```terraform
# Existing state
resource "minio_s3_bucket" "customer" {
  bucket = var.customer_name
}

# Migration (keeps existing bucket, new buckets use a generated suffix)
resource "minio_s3_bucket" "customer" {
  bucket_prefix = "${var.customer_name}-"
}
```

- Bucket tagging requires support from the underlying S3-compatible endpoint. If your endpoint does not support tagging, you can set `skip_bucket_tagging = true` in the provider configuration to disable tagging operations and prevent errors.

## Argument Reference

- `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the bucket. Tags are key-value pairs that help you organize and categorize your buckets.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# S3 buckets can be imported using the bucket name
terraform import minio_s3_bucket.example bucket-name
```
