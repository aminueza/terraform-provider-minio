  Manage anonymous access to an existing MinIO bucket using canned access types or fully custom JSON policies.
---

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

Use this resource when you want to expose part (or all) of a bucket to anonymous clients. It builds on the standard bucket policy primitives while adding conveniences for canned policies and importable state.

> **Important:** For a given bucket, manage anonymous access with either this resource _or_ `minio_s3_bucket_policy`—not both. They share the same underlying bucket policy and will constantly fight each other if applied simultaneously.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/minio_s3_bucket_anonymous_access/resource.tf" }}

- `access_type` supports MinIO canned modes (`public`, `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `public-write`).
- `policy` accepts any valid S3/MinIO policy JSON. When both `policy` and `access_type` are set, the explicit JSON policy always wins.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Anonymous access is keyed by bucket name
terraform import minio_s3_bucket_anonymous_access.example bucket-name
```
